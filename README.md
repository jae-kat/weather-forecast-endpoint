This is a small Next.js project in addition to the code challenges I just wrote.
The site displays outdoor workouts and fetches the weather forecast for each workout time & location.
--> The example workouts and dates are taken from an API endpoint and are static, for the forecast to work year-round it will ignore the displayed date and always forecast the next several days instead

clone the repo and run
`yarn install`

Add an api key for weatherbit.io in an .env file

`yarn dev` to open the project locally on your browser
